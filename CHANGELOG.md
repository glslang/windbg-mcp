## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Driver IOCTL discovery & user-mode reachability.** A new
  [`driver-ioctl.md`](skills/windbg-debugging/driver-ioctl.md) playbook documents a
  static-first, dynamic-confirm workflow for enumerating a driver's IOCTL surface and
  testing whether each code is reachable from user mode (the openable → namespace →
  deliverable → handled gate model), with WinDbg-native (`uf`) static enumeration by
  default and Binary Ninja as an optional escalation. Five supporting tools:
  - `decode_ioctl` — decode a 32-bit control code into its `CTL_CODE` fields and flag
    `METHOD_NEITHER` / `FILE_ANY_ACCESS` (pure; no session needed).
  - `driver_object` — dump a driver's dispatch table + devices (`!drvobj <name> 7`).
  - `device_object` — inspect a device object's type/characteristics/SecurityDescriptor
    (`!devobj`) to answer the *openable* gate.
  - `irp_stack` — dump an IRP's current `IO_STACK_LOCATION` (`!irp`), defaulting the IRP
    to `@rdx` at a dispatch break.
  - `ioctl_trace` — install a conditional logging breakpoint at the IOCTL dispatch
    routine that prints each `IoControlCode` + buffer lengths and continues.
  - An `examples/sweep_ioctls.ps1` harness driving the dynamic confirm sweep.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- Ending a live-kernel session (`end_session`) no longer leaves the target
  **frozen**. It was a passive detach, which never tells the target to run, so
  detaching while halted at a break left the guest frozen — one CPU halted, the
  rest spinning — with the breakpoint `int3` still patched. `end_session` now
  clears breakpoints, resumes the target, and does an active detach, leaving the
  kernel running. (win-kexp `777b5c2`.)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- **Live kernel debugging now works.** `attach_kernel` / `attach_kernel_local`
  connect, request an initial break-in, and wait with the INFINITE timeout a live
  kernel requires — a finite timeout returned `E_NOTIMPL` and never drove the
  connection — so the engine breaks in, breakpoints resolve, and `go` runs to them.
  The wait is bounded by a watchdog (`SetInterrupt`) so the single engine thread
  can't hang on an unresponsive target; a forced timeout is reported as an error.
- A failed kernel attach now returns a clean error instead of panicking the
  debugger worker thread.
- `go`/step with no active debuggee now returns a clear "No active debuggee" error
  instead of crashing the server (a previously uncatchable engine fault).

### Added

- Example stdio JSON-RPC drivers under `examples/` (live-kernel attach, user-mode
  launch, and robustness regression checks).

### Changed

- The live/kernel skill now instructs asking the user for the target's actual KDNET
  connection string (the port and key can't be guessed).
- CI auto-approves and auto-merges Dependabot PRs.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Prebuilt Windows x64 binary releases: pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag now builds
  `windbg-mcp.exe` and attaches `windbg-mcp-vX.Y.Z-windows-x64.zip` (plus a SHA256
  checksum) to the GitHub release, and the setup docs gained a no-Rust install path
  that downloads it into `target\release\`.
- Signed build-provenance attestations for release zips, verifiable with
  `gh attestation verify` (see the README's *Releasing* section).

### Security

- GitHub Actions in the CI and release workflows are pinned to immutable
  commit SHAs, with Dependabot configured to keep the pins (and their
  version comments) up to date.

## [0.1.0]

Initial release, packaged as a single-plugin Claude Code marketplace.

### Added

- **`windbg` MCP server** (Rust, stdio) exposing DbgEng-backed debugging tools:
  session management (open dump/trace, attach to process/kernel, launch, end),
  state queries (registers, memory read, backtrace, modules, threads,
  disassemble, `dx`), execution control (go, step over/into, breakpoints), Time
  Travel Debugging navigation (step back, reverse go, goto position) and
  analysis (`ttd_calls`, `ttd_memory`, `ttd_events`, index), TTD trace recording,
  and a raw `execute` command passthrough.
- **`windbg-debugging` skill** with task playbooks: setup, crash-dump triage,
  live/kernel debugging, and TTD recording/replay/analysis.
- Crash-dump `!analyze` support via automatic WinDbg extension DLL loading.
- Windows CI (format, clippy, build, test) and walkthrough docs with sample dumps.
