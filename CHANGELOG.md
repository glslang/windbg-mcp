# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Prebuilt Windows x64 binary releases: pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag now builds
  `windbg-mcp.exe` and attaches `windbg-mcp-vX.Y.Z-windows-x64.zip` (plus a SHA256
  checksum) to the GitHub release, and the setup docs gained a no-Rust install path
  that downloads it into `target\release\`.
- Signed build-provenance attestations for release zips, verifiable with
  `gh attestation verify` (see the README's *Releasing* section).

### Security

- GitHub Actions in the CI and release workflows are pinned to immutable
  commit SHAs, with Dependabot configured to keep the pins (and their
  version comments) up to date.

## [0.1.0]

Initial release, packaged as a single-plugin Claude Code marketplace.

### Added

- **`windbg` MCP server** (Rust, stdio) exposing DbgEng-backed debugging tools:
  session management (open dump/trace, attach to process/kernel, launch, end),
  state queries (registers, memory read, backtrace, modules, threads,
  disassemble, `dx`), execution control (go, step over/into, breakpoints), Time
  Travel Debugging navigation (step back, reverse go, goto position) and
  analysis (`ttd_calls`, `ttd_memory`, `ttd_events`, index), TTD trace recording,
  and a raw `execute` command passthrough.
- **`windbg-debugging` skill** with task playbooks: setup, crash-dump triage,
  live/kernel debugging, and TTD recording/replay/analysis.
- Crash-dump `!analyze` support via automatic WinDbg extension DLL loading.
- Windows CI (format, clippy, build, test) and walkthrough docs with sample dumps.
