## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Static IOCTL dispatch reachability.** A new `reachable_from_dispatch` tool answers
  whether a code block — given as an absolute address or `module`+`rva` — is reachable from
  a driver's IOCTL dispatch routine, via a bounded breadth-first walk over the call graph
  built from repeated `uf` disassembly. It follows direct calls and cross-function tail
  jumps; it does **not** follow indirect calls through function pointers or unresolved
  compiler jump tables, so a `REACHABLE` verdict is sound (and reports the call path) while
  `NOT REACHABLE` is a best-effort within-bounds result. The `uf`-parsing and graph-walk
  logic is pure and unit-tested (no debugger needed).
- **Driver IOCTL discovery & user-mode reachability.** A new
  [`driver-ioctl.md`](skills/windbg-debugging/driver-ioctl.md) playbook documents a
  static-first, dynamic-confirm workflow for enumerating a driver's IOCTL surface and
  testing whether each code is reachable from user mode (the openable → namespace →
  deliverable → handled gate model), with WinDbg-native (`uf`) static enumeration by
  default and Binary Ninja as an optional escalation. Five supporting tools:
  - `decode_ioctl` — decode a 32-bit control code into its `CTL_CODE` fields and flag
    `METHOD_NEITHER` / `FILE_ANY_ACCESS` (pure; no session needed).
  - `driver_object` — dump a driver's dispatch table + devices (`!drvobj <name> 7`).
  - `device_object` — inspect a device object's type/characteristics/SecurityDescriptor
    (`!devobj`) to answer the *openable* gate.
  - `irp_stack` — dump an IRP's current `IO_STACK_LOCATION` (`!irp`), defaulting the IRP
    to `@rdx` at a dispatch break.
  - `ioctl_trace` — install a conditional logging breakpoint at the IOCTL dispatch
    routine that prints each `IoControlCode` + buffer lengths and continues.
  - An `examples/sweep_ioctls.ps1` harness (host) + `examples/send_ioctls_target.ps1`
    (target-side `DeviceIoControl` sender) driving the dynamic confirm sweep.
  - `attach_kernel` / `attach_kernel_local` now `.load kdexts` automatically so the
    `!drvobj`/`!devobj`/`!irp` commands behind `driver_object`/`device_object`/`irp_stack`
    resolve; `setup.md` bundles `winxp\kdexts.dll`. Verified end-to-end against a live
    KDNET kernel (the tools captured real mountmgr IOCTLs).
  - [`docs/driver-ioctl-walkthrough.md`](docs/driver-ioctl-walkthrough.md): a worked
    `\Driver\mountmgr` enumeration + reachability report against a live kernel. The
    playbook now ends with a "Write the report" step + template.
- **`record_trace` `env` and `working_dir` options** — pass extra `KEY=VALUE` environment
  entries and a working directory to the recorded target, for programs that refuse to run
  without a specific environment (e.g. a Qt app's `QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH`, or an
  anti-analysis "run me from here" guard). Previously the recorder only inherited the
  server's environment.

### Fixed

- **`index_trace` now works.** It invoked `!tt.index`, which fails with `LoadLibrary(tt)` —
  there is no `tt` extension. The bundled engine exposes trace indexing through `TtdExt.dll`,
  so `index_trace` now runs `!ttdext.index` (building a persistent `.idx` next to the `.run`).
- **`open_trace` flags an unindexed trace.** A freshly recorded `.run` has no `.idx`, so the
  first data-model query silently builds an in-memory index and can run long; `open_trace`
  now says so up front (via `!ttdext.index -status`) and points at `index_trace`.
- **`registers` no longer returns a blank result** when there is no thread context (a
  module-load break or a bare `goto_position 0`); it explains why and how to get a context.
- **A runaway debugger command no longer wedges the session.** `execute`, `dx`, and the
  `ttd_*` query tools now run through a bounded path
  ([`win-kexp`](https://github.com/glslang/win-kexp)'s `execute_command_bounded`) that
  `SetInterrupt`s the engine shortly before the per-call timeout. Previously an unbounded
  command — most importantly a broad `s` memory search — could pin the single engine thread
  indefinitely, so every later tool call timed out behind it and the only recovery was to
  kill and reconnect the server. Now such a command self-aborts (with a note) and the engine
  stays usable. (win-kexp pin bumped to include `execute_command_bounded` + its interrupt drain.)

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- Ending a live-kernel session (`end_session`) no longer leaves the target
  **frozen**. It was a passive detach, which never tells the target to run, so
  detaching while halted at a break left the guest frozen — one CPU halted, the
  rest spinning — with the breakpoint `int3` still patched. `end_session` now
  clears breakpoints, resumes the target, and does an active detach, leaving the
  kernel running. (win-kexp `777b5c2`.)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- **Live kernel debugging now works.** `attach_kernel` / `attach_kernel_local`
  connect, request an initial break-in, and wait with the INFINITE timeout a live
  kernel requires — a finite timeout returned `E_NOTIMPL` and never drove the
  connection — so the engine breaks in, breakpoints resolve, and `go` runs to them.
  The wait is bounded by a watchdog (`SetInterrupt`) so the single engine thread
  can't hang on an unresponsive target; a forced timeout is reported as an error.
- A failed kernel attach now returns a clean error instead of panicking the
  debugger worker thread.
- `go`/step with no active debuggee now returns a clear "No active debuggee" error
  instead of crashing the server (a previously uncatchable engine fault).

### Added

- Example stdio JSON-RPC drivers under `examples/` (live-kernel attach, user-mode
  launch, and robustness regression checks).

### Changed

- The live/kernel skill now instructs asking the user for the target's actual KDNET
  connection string (the port and key can't be guessed).
- CI auto-approves and auto-merges Dependabot PRs.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Prebuilt Windows x64 binary releases: pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag now builds
  `windbg-mcp.exe` and attaches `windbg-mcp-vX.Y.Z-windows-x64.zip` (plus a SHA256
  checksum) to the GitHub release, and the setup docs gained a no-Rust install path
  that downloads it into `target\release\`.
- Signed build-provenance attestations for release zips, verifiable with
  `gh attestation verify` (see the README's *Releasing* section).

### Security

- GitHub Actions in the CI and release workflows are pinned to immutable
  commit SHAs, with Dependabot configured to keep the pins (and their
  version comments) up to date.

## [0.1.0]

Initial release, packaged as a single-plugin Claude Code marketplace.

### Added

- **`windbg` MCP server** (Rust, stdio) exposing DbgEng-backed debugging tools:
  session management (open dump/trace, attach to process/kernel, launch, end),
  state queries (registers, memory read, backtrace, modules, threads,
  disassemble, `dx`), execution control (go, step over/into, breakpoints), Time
  Travel Debugging navigation (step back, reverse go, goto position) and
  analysis (`ttd_calls`, `ttd_memory`, `ttd_events`, index), TTD trace recording,
  and a raw `execute` command passthrough.
- **`windbg-debugging` skill** with task playbooks: setup, crash-dump triage,
  live/kernel debugging, and TTD recording/replay/analysis.
- Crash-dump `!analyze` support via automatic WinDbg extension DLL loading.
- Windows CI (format, clippy, build, test) and walkthrough docs with sample dumps.
