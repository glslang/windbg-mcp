An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that exposes **WinDbg/DbgEng** to AI agents
(Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, …) over stdio. It drives a live debugger engine for
**user-mode**, **kernel-mode**, **crash-dump**, and **Time Travel Debugging (TTD)** workflows.

The low-level engine bindings live in [`win-kexp`](https://github.com/glslang/win-kexp)
(`src/dbgeng.rs`); this crate adds process-per-session engine supervision and the `rmcp` tool
surface on top.

## Architecture

**One debug session per process.** dbgeng.dll holds a single debuggee session per process — that is
why `.opendump` *replaces* the target rather than opening a second one — so this server runs the MCP
protocol in a **supervisor** process and each open target in its own **engine worker** child
process. Two things follow, and they are why it is built this way:

- **A session that cannot be unwound costs a process, not the server.** A live-kernel attach waits
  for its target with `WaitForEvent(INFINITE)`, and nothing can interrupt a wait that has not yet
  connected — so a guest that never dials in blocks forever. That blocks one worker, which
  `end_session` can terminate. It used to block the server's only engine thread, and the only
  recovery was restarting the server.
- **Sessions are concurrent.** Triage a crash dump while a kernel attach is live; keep a TTD trace
  open while you look at another. Up to four at once.

- **`engine.rs`** — the supervisor: the session registry, worker spawn/teardown, and the routing
  that turns a `session_id` into "which worker". Each session has one queue with one consumer, so
  calls against a session are serialized and ordered even though sessions are not.
- **`worker.rs`** — the child process. The `DebugEngine` is created on, and confined to, one OS
  thread inside it (DbgEng requires serialized, single-thread access, and `WaitForEvent` must run on
  the session-owning thread). A `catch_unwind` guard turns a panic in one operation into a failed
  call rather than a dead session.
- **`proto.rs`** — the line-delimited JSON protocol between the two. A closure cannot cross a
  process boundary, so what used to be closures marshalled onto the engine thread are now
  serializable operations — deliberately *tool*-shaped rather than DbgEng-shaped, so a tool that is
  several engine calls (`reachable_from_dispatch`'s call-graph walk) stays one indivisible job.
- **`server.rs`** — the MCP tools (see below), built with `rmcp`'s `#[tool_router]`/`#[tool_handler]`.
- **`ttd.rs`** — locates `TTD.exe` and launches trace recording.
- **`main.rs`** — role selection (supervisor or worker), tokio + stdio transport. **Logs go to
  stderr** (stdout is the JSON-RPC channel); workers inherit the supervisor's stderr, so everything
  lands in the same place. Workers never outlive the connection: they are terminated on shutdown,
  and exit on their own when their stdin closes.

**MCP protocol revision:** built on `rmcp` 3.x, this server accepts every revision that SDK knows —
`2026-07-28` and the `initialize`-handshake ("legacy") era before it (`2025-11-25`, `2025-06-18`,
`2025-03-26`, `2024-11-05`) — and serves whichever the client selects. A `2026-07-28` client gets the
stateless, per-request model (`server/discover`, `resultType`, per-request `_meta`) and may open with
`server/discover` instead of `initialize`; older clients keep the handshake, and a client that offers
an unknown revision is answered with `2025-11-25`.

## Requirements

- Windows x64 (host bitness must match the target).
- `dbgeng.dll` / `dbghelp.dll` — present in `System32` on modern Windows 11 (verified with
  `10.0.26100`). This is enough for live user-mode/kernel debugging and crash-dump analysis.
- **For crash-dump `!analyze`** (and any other `!`-extension command), the engine needs the
  WinDbg `winext\` extensions bundled next to the binary — System32's engine ships none, so
  `!analyze` would return *"No export analyze found"*. See *Bundling the WinDbg engine* below.
- **For Time Travel Debugging (`.run`) replay**, the System32 engine is *not* enough — it rejects
  `.run` traces (`0x80070057`). You need the **WinDbg engine** (which bundles the TTD replay
  components) loaded next to the binary — see *TTD engine* below.
- `TTD.exe` (the standalone Time Travel Debugging recorder) for `record_trace` — ships with the
  WinDbg / TTD store packages; put it on `PATH`.
- A reachable symbol server (e.g. `srv*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols`) for symbol-name
  queries like `ttd_calls("ucrtbase!_stdio_common_vfprintf")`. Offline, address-based queries and the
  data model still work; symbol *names* won't resolve.
- **Administrator** for live kernel debugging and TTD recording (not for replay).

## Build or download

Prebuilt Windows x64 binaries are attached to each
[GitHub release](https://github.com/glslang/windbg-mcp/releases) as
`windbg-mcp-vX.Y.Z-windows-x64.zip` (with a `SHA256SUMS.txt` to verify the download
against — the skill's `setup.md` snippet does this for you) — no Rust toolchain needed.
To build from source instead:

```pwsh
cargo build --release
```

`win-kexp` is fetched automatically as a git dependency from [`glslang/win-kexp`](https://github.com/glslang/win-kexp) — no sibling checkout needed.

`cargo test` covers the unit tests plus an end-to-end smoke test that drives the built binary over
stdio. Run it after a dependency bump or an MCP spec revision — see
[`docs/smoke-test.md`](docs/smoke-test.md).

### Bundling the WinDbg engine

Needed for two things: TTD `.run` replay (System32's engine rejects traces with `0x80070057`) and
crash-dump `!analyze` (which lives in the `winext\` extensions that System32 doesn't ship).
`DebugCreate` binds to whichever `dbgeng.dll` the loader finds first, and the app directory is
searched before `System32`, so the copied **WinDbg** engine (which replays TTD traces and ships the
extensions) wins. One-time, from the installed WinDbg store package:

```pwsh
$wd  = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WinDbg).InstallLocation + "\amd64"
$dst = "C:\workspace\windbg-mcp\target\release"
Copy-Item "$wd\dbgeng.dll","$wd\dbghelp.dll","$wd\dbgcore.dll","$wd\dbgmodel.dll",`
          "$wd\symsrv.dll","$wd\msdia140.dll" $dst -Force
Copy-Item "$wd\ttd"    "$dst\ttd"    -Recurse -Force   # TTDReplay*.dll, TtdExt.dll, TTDAnalyze.dll, ...
Copy-Item "$wd\winext" "$dst\winext" -Recurse -Force   # ext.dll (!analyze), kext.dll, … — crash-dump triage
```

- The `ttd\` subdir provides the `@$cursession.TTD` / `@$curprocess.TTD` data model and the `!tt`
  time-travel commands.
- The `winext\` subdir provides `ext.dll` (which exports `!analyze`) and the other `!`-extensions.
  `open_dump` runs `.load ext` for you, but note the **unqualified `!analyze` does not resolve** on
  this minimal engine — use the module-qualified **`!ext.analyze -v`** for crash-dump triage. Without
  `winext\`, `!analyze` returns *"No export analyze found"*.
- **`msdia140.dll` is required for PDB symbols.** Without it, `dbghelp` can't parse any PDB
  (`dia error 0x8007007e`) and silently falls back to *export* symbols — which makes `module!name`
  lookups (and so `ttd_calls("ucrtbase!__stdio_common_vfprintf")`) fail even with the right PDB in
  the cache. `symsrv.dll` is needed to read a symbol-store cache.

(`cargo clean` wipes `target\`, so re-copy after one.) Live and dump debugging work with or without
the TTD engine; PDB symbol *names* need `msdia140.dll` + a symbol path
(`execute` → `.sympath srv*C:\ProgramData\Dbg\sym*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols`).

## Use with an MCP client

Point your client at the built binary, e.g. Claude Code:

```jsonc
// .mcp.json  (or claude_desktop_config.json under "mcpServers")
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "windbg": {
      "command": "C:\\workspace\\windbg-mcp\\target\\release\\windbg-mcp.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

### As a Claude Code plugin

This repo is also a single-plugin [Claude Code marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces):
installing it registers the `windbg` MCP server **and** a `windbg-debugging` skill that
knows how to drive it (setup, crash-dump, live/kernel, and TTD playbooks).

```text
/plugin marketplace add glslang/windbg-mcp
/plugin install windbg-mcp@windbg-mcp
```

The plugin ships source, not a binary, so after installing you still put the server binary in
place — download a prebuilt release or build from source — and (for `.run` replay and
crash-dump `!analyze`) bundle the WinDbg engine — the skill's `setup.md`
walks through it, and it mirrors the [*Build or download*](#build-or-download) and
[*Bundling the WinDbg engine*](#bundling-the-windbg-engine) sections above. Then `/reload-plugins`
to connect the server. The plugin points at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/target/release/windbg-mcp.exe`.

### From the official MCP registry

The server is listed in the [official MCP registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) as
**`io.github.glslang/windbg-mcp`**. Clients that support the registry — or that install
[MCPB](https://github.com/anthropics/mcpb) bundles directly — can add it by name: the client
downloads that release's `.mcpb` bundle, verifies its SHA-256, and wires up the `windbg-mcp.exe`
inside it as an stdio server, with no Rust build or manual binary placement.

The bundle is **Windows x64 only** and ships just the server binary, so the one-time engine setup
still applies — for TTD `.run` replay and crash-dump `!analyze`, drop the WinDbg engine DLLs next
to the client-extracted `windbg-mcp.exe` (the skill's `setup.md` covers it). Basic live and
crash-dump work runs on the in-box `System32` engine without them.

### Releasing

The plugin sets an explicit `version` in
[`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](.claude-plugin/plugin.json), so users only receive an update
when that version changes — pushing commits alone does not trigger one. To cut a release, bump
`version` in `plugin.json` and `Cargo.toml`, bump the release badge near the top of this README,
add a matching entry to
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md), and tag the commit `vX.Y.Z`. Run
`claude plugin validate . --strict` before publishing. Pushing the tag runs
[`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml), which verifies the tag matches both manifest
versions and the README badge, builds `windbg-mcp.exe`, and attaches the zip + SHA256 checksum to the GitHub release.
It also builds an [MCPB](https://github.com/anthropics/mcpb) bundle
(`windbg-mcp-vX.Y.Z-windows-x64.mcpb`, described by
[`packaging/mcpb/manifest.json`](packaging/mcpb/manifest.json)) and publishes a
[`server.json`](server.json) entry to the [official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io)
(`io.github.glslang/windbg-mcp`) with the `mcp-publisher` CLI over GitHub OIDC — no secrets. CI
stamps the release version into both files and the bundle's SHA-256 into `server.json`, so
neither is part of the manual bump list above.
The zip also gets a signed
[build-provenance attestation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/using-artifact-attestations)
tying it to the workflow run that built it — verify with:

```pwsh
gh attestation verify <zip> --repo glslang/windbg-mcp `
   --signer-workflow glslang/windbg-mcp/.github/workflows/release.yml
```

(`--repo` alone only proves the attestation came from *some* workflow in this repo;
`--signer-workflow` pins it to the release workflow.)

## Walkthroughs

  minidump ([`docs/samples/052126-34312-01.dmp`](docs/samples/052126-34312-01.dmp)): a
  `0x9F DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE` traced to `nvlddmkm.sys` via `!ext.analyze -v` and a manual
  device-stack walk, with the real outputs and the partial-minidump (`0x80040205`) gotcha.
- [`docs/ttd-walkthrough.md`](docs/ttd-walkthrough.md) — a hands-on tour of the TTD tools against the
  [`xusheng6/TTD_lab`](https://github.com/xusheng6/TTD_lab) `helloworld` sample: opening a `.run`,
  surveying events/threads, forward/reverse navigation, memory analysis, and counting `printf` calls
  with symbols (with the real outputs and the gotchas). It maps each tool to the lab's exercises.
- [`docs/flareauthenticator-ttd-walkthrough.md`](docs/flareauthenticator-ttd-walkthrough.md) — a full
  **TTD → Z3 solve** of an obfuscated Qt crackme (Flare-On 12 #8). Defeats an anti-analysis env guard,
  records a wrong-guess run, and uses `ttd_calls`/`ttd_memory`/reverse-navigation to peel control-flow
  flattening + computed calls + encrypted strings down to the exact check: a per-keystroke rolling hash
  that reduces to a pure weighted sum. The 25 weights come from the replay, the 250 `g` values from
  debugger function-evaluation, and Z3 finds a satisfying code — which reveals the flag (the code is
  intentionally non-unique). Runnable solver in [`examples/flareauthenticator/`](examples/flareauthenticator/);

- [`docs/driver-ioctl-walkthrough.md`](docs/driver-ioctl-walkthrough.md) — enumerating a driver's IOCTL
  surface and deciding user-mode reachability on a live KDNET kernel: `driver_object`/`uf` to recover
  the `\Driver\mountmgr` dispatch switch, `decode_ioctl` for the access tiers, the device DACL parsed
  from memory, and an `ioctl_trace` sweep — ending with a reachability report (which codes a standard
  user can reach vs. what the I/O manager blocks).

### Sessions and session handles

The six Session tools that open a target (`open_dump`, `open_trace`, `attach_kernel_local`,
`attach_kernel`, `attach_process`, `launch`) each create a **session** — one engine worker process
holding one target — and return a **`session_id`**. Every tool that touches a target accepts that id
as an optional argument, and it is what **routes** the call to the right worker.

Sessions are independent. Opening a second target does not disturb the first, a call against one
does not queue behind work in another, and ending one leaves the rest alone. Up to `4` at once; at
the limit a new open reclaims the oldest **idle** session, and if every session has a call in flight
the open is refused with the list rather than picking a victim. Sessions end when you `end_session`
them or when the client disconnects — nothing is left running afterwards.

Omit `session_id` and a call goes to the **current** session: the most recently opened one that will
still accept work. That is the pre-handle behaviour and it still holds. What supplying the id buys
is that the call can never land on a target you did not open — it fails loudly instead.
`decode_ioctl` (pure) and `record_trace` (independent of any debug session) do not take one.

`session_status` lists every session — what it is, what state it is in, how long it has been there,
and which one is current — or reports on one you name. It never queues on any worker, so it answers
even while a session is parked.

**Recovering a session that is stuck.** A per-call timeout abandons the *wait*, not the job, so a
call that reports a timeout may still be running. The case that matters is `attach_kernel`: it waits
for the target to dial in with no timeout, and DbgEng cannot interrupt a wait that has not yet
connected — so a guest that is powered off, not booted with debugging enabled, or pointed at the
wrong host/port/key never arrives, and that wait never ends. `session_status` distinguishes a link
that is still coming up (normal, ~25s for a KDNET resync) from one that has been waiting far longer
than a healthy attach ever takes. For the second, `end_session` is the recovery: it asks the worker
to let go, and terminates the worker process if it will not. Do **not** re-run the open while it is
still waiting — the target was already claimed, so that would attach a second time.

Two caveats, both in the command hatches, and both now confined to a single session. The typed tools
announce their own transitions, but `execute` can replace its session's target directly
(`.opendump`, `.attach`, `.detach`, `.kill`, `.restart`, `.abandon`, `.remote`, `q`/`qd`/`qq`), and
those commands **retire** that session's handle: calls passing it are refused, while calls that pass
no id still reach the worker. `dx` is the second hatch — the data model reaches
`Debugger.Utility.Control.ExecuteCommand`, which runs any command, so an expression that touches
command execution retires the handle too, conservatively, since the command it runs is a runtime
string this server never sees.

Both matches are deliberately biased toward retiring: over-matching costs one re-open,
under-matching would let a stale handle through. Neither can be exhaustive — DbgEng has more ways to
reach the target than a name list can enumerate, and the data model is extensible — so inside
`execute` and `dx` a handle is a strong hint rather than a guarantee. Everywhere else it is a
guarantee, and it is enforced at the front of that session's queue, after everything queued ahead of
it: checking on the caller's side would leave a window in which an `execute { ".opendump …" }`
already queued ahead retires the handle between a caller's check and its call.

### Typed operands are operands, not commands

The typed tools build debugger commands by interpolation (`u {address}`, `bp {expression}`,
`!drvobj {name} 7`), so those parameters refuse `;`, line breaks, and `"` — the last everywhere
except `dx`, whose data-model expressions use quoted literals legitimately.

Two things go wrong without that. DbgEng treats `;` as a command separator, so
`disassemble { address: "rip; .opendump C:\other.dmp" }` would replace the debug target from a tool
that reports itself read-only. And `bp <location> "command"` is real WinDbg syntax — `ioctl_trace`
builds exactly that form — so a quote in a breakpoint location arms a command that runs on every
hit, replacing the target at some arbitrary later moment, outside any tool call and outside anything
that could retire the session handle.

Nothing legitimate is lost: these parameters were always single operands. Use `execute` to run a
command list — it is annotated destructive and retires the handle when a command changes the target.

### Error reporting

Anything scoped to a session comes back as a normal tool result with `isError: true` and the text
intact, so the model can read it and correct itself: a failed *debugger operation* (an unresolvable
symbol, an unreadable address, a target that never stopped), a refused handle, a timeout, a session
whose worker is gone. Each has a next move. The only JSON-RPC protocol error is the one failure that
is the server's rather than a session's — no engine worker could be started at all.

The forward (`go`/`step_over`/`step_into`) and reverse (`reverse_go`/`step_over_back`/`step_back`)
control tools mirror a debugger UI's F9/F8/F7 and Shift+F9/F8/F7, so an agent can drive a trace in
both directions and jump anywhere with `goto_position`. All of these issue the command **and pump the
engine to the next stop** (a plain `Execute` only sets the run state — it doesn't move the target),
which is what makes both live stepping and TTD forward/reverse navigation actually advance.

`ttd_calls`/`ttd_memory`/`ttd_events` are convenience wrappers over the TTD data model: `ttd_calls`
and `ttd_memory` query `@$cursession.TTD.{Calls,Memory}` (every call to a function / every access to
an address range), and `ttd_events` queries `@$curprocess.TTD.Events` (the module/thread/exception
timeline). For anything else, `dx` evaluates arbitrary data-model/LINQ expressions, e.g.
`@$cursession.TTD.Calls("ntdll!NtCreateFile").Where(c => c.ReturnValue != 0)`.

## Limitations & notes

- **TTD is user-mode only** (a Microsoft limitation): kernel debugging and TTD are distinct session
  types — you can't time-travel a kernel target.
- `launch` and `attach_process` stop the target at its initial/break-in point with a live
  process/thread context. (The binding enables the initial-breakpoint event filter — `sxe ibp` —
  which a bare `DebugCreate` host leaves off; without it the target would run free.) Note: on
  Windows 11 `notepad` is a Store app, so attaching by the PID that `Start-Process notepad` returns
  can hit `0xD000010A` (that PID is a transient launcher) — attach to a classic Win32 process.
- `read_memory` takes a numeric/`0x`-hex address only; for register/symbol expressions use
  `execute` with `db`/`dd` (e.g. `db @rip`).
- `reachable_from_dispatch` is a **static** call-graph walk over `uf` disassembly: it follows
  direct calls and cross-function tail jumps but **not** indirect calls through function pointers
  or unresolved compiler jump tables. So a `REACHABLE` verdict is sound (a concrete static path
  exists, and the path is reported), while `NOT REACHABLE` is best-effort within the explored
  bounds. If the dispatch uses a `switch(IoControlCode)` jump table (common), pass the specific
  handler VA as `from` to scope past it, or confirm dynamically with a breakpoint + `go`.
- **Crash-dump triage uses `!ext.analyze -v`**, not `!analyze` — the bundled engine only resolves
  the module-qualified form (see *Bundling the WinDbg engine*). On a **partial minidump**, reads of
  pages that weren't captured raise `An unexpected exception was raised (0x80040205)` rather than a
  clean "memory read error"; query the specific field you need (e.g.
  `dt nt!_DRIVER_OBJECT <addr> DriverName`) instead of dumping whole structures. See the
  [crash-dump walkthrough](docs/crash-dump-walkthrough.md).
- Single-stepping is only valid once the target is stopped with a real thread context (after a
  `go`/step or a breakpoint hit). Stepping straight after a bare `goto_position` to the very start of
  a trace (before any thread is live) returns `0x80040205` — `go` to a breakpoint first.
- Symbol *names* (`module!func`) need (a) `msdia140.dll` bundled next to the binary, (b) a symbol
  path pointing at the PDBs (`.sympath …`), and (c) for TTD, reloading at a *stopped* position
  (after a `go`/breakpoint, not straight off a `!tt`) so the module's PDB is matched and loaded.
  With those, e.g. `ttd_calls("ucrtbase!__stdio_common_vfprintf")` returns the exact call count.
  Without symbols, the data model, navigation, and memory reads still work — query by address.
- **One command at a time per session.** Sessions run concurrently, but each one is a single engine
  processing operations serially, so a call against a busy session waits its turn. Issue tool calls
  for a given session **sequentially — await each result before sending the next**: the server does
  not order concurrent in-flight requests against each other, so pipelining them (firing several
  calls before their results return) can run a command before the one that establishes its state,
  and is meaningless for stateful, order-dependent debugger commands anyway. Standard MCP clients
  already serialize call→result, so this is only a concern for custom/batched callers.
- **Sessions are a bounded resource.** Each is a process holding a dump, a trace, or a live target,
  and at most `4` are open at once. `end_session` when you are done with one rather than relying on
  the oldest idle session being reclaimed.
- TTD **replay** (`open_trace`) needs `TTDReplay.dll` discoverable but **not** elevation; TTD
  **recording** (`record_trace`) needs `TTD.exe` **and** Administrator. `record_trace` captures the
  recorder's startup output to `<out_dir>\ttd_record.log` and watches it briefly, so a fast failure
  (e.g. running un-elevated → `0x80070005 Access is denied`) is reported as an error rather than a
  false "recording started".
- Control-flow tools (`go`/`step*`) issue the corresponding debugger command; precise stop/wait
  semantics for long-running `go` against a live target are bounded by the per-call timeout.
